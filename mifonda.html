          <strong> The challenge: </strong> MiFonda is a technology startup
          focused on helping small restaurants grow by helping them manage their
          online presence, providing ordering, pickup, and delivery service.
          They didn’t want to imitate the typical online ordering experience --
          instead, they tasked my team to create a visual-foward, interactive
          storefront for both mobile and desktop users.

            <h4>1. Initial Brainstorm and Design</h4>
          </div>
          <p>
            After our initial briefing by the MiFonda team, my team of fellow
            Brown students Anna Wang, Jaclyn Cohen, and Pranavi Lakshminarayanan
            began with our first drafts. One of our primary goals was
            maintaining a balance between visual creativity and an intuitive
            user experience, and we agreed horizontal video carousels were a
            positive media-forward implementation that wasn't visually
            overwhelming. We also decided to pursue a liking system, and thought
            it was a great way to engage users and promote interaction with the
            application, alongside communicate popular orders. Pulling from the
            various designs for further ideas of popups, symbols, sorting, and
            customization, we integrated our initial sketches and brainstorms
            into a Figma model to outline our plans to the client.

            <h4>2. Feedback and Low-fi Wireframes</h4>
          </div>
          <p>
            In a round of critique with our peers, the main area noted for
            improvement was consistent design across our mobile and desktop
            platforms. We wanted to ensure, moving forward, that the two
            versions were aligned for memorability and unification. Peers also
            encouraged us to think carefully about what elements were truly
            necessary, how the video carousel might operate with autoplay or
            pausing, and where we place certain features in relation to the
            purchase and checkout processes. When we sent our wireframes to the
            MiFonda team, they clarified their vision of focusing in on one
            restaurant rather than a selection, and compress the features into a
            single screen. Given this feedback, we revised our wireframes
            accordingly. We incorporated all of the feedback into our new
            designs; each page is specific to a store, there is more
            consideration of similar placement between the mobile and desktop
            versions, and the unique features were displayed prominently, among
            other smaller changes.

            <h4>3. Hi-fi Prototyping</h4>
          </div>
          <p>
            We built on the visual style guide provided and developed our hi-fi
            prototype. Fonda sent us a preliminary style guide containing the
            typography and color scheme. The founders gave us free reign over
            any style guide edits, so we developed various elements and symbols,
            including the drop-down menus, buttons, and banners. We also wanted
            to ensure accessibility in the usage of keyboard-navigable features
            and high-contrast colors. Using these guidelines, we developed our
            high-fidelity prototypes.

            <h4>4. Founder feedback</h4>
          </div>
          <p>
            The founders expressed a lot of positive feedback! They praised our
            design as “super innovative” and appreciated the visual-forward
            implementation, especially the videos. We discussed a few scenarios
            that might stretch the limitations of our design, such as multiple
            promo codes, or the potential of longer videos such as hearing from
            chefs. Overall, it was valuable to work with and hear from founders
            in a startup environment, and we are all extremely appreciative of
            the opportunity to practice our design and development skills in a
            more professional setting.

            <h4>5. Final Thoughts</h4>
          </div>
          <p>
            This project taught me a lot about effectively working in a team-
            both with other designers and with a real startup to meet the needs
            of everyone involved. Each designer pitched some great ideas that
            came together to create the final product, contributing to a
            synchronous design in both aesthetics and functionality. As an
            individual, I contributed most to the low-fidelity prototype
            development, alongside leading a lot of the communication with the
            MiFonda team.
