          <strong> The challenge: </strong> With soon-expiring licensing, Brown
          Political Review's website needed a complete rebuild. BPR Executive
          Board decided to transition away from external hosting like Wix and
          instead create an independently built site to promote longevity and
          flexibility. The program needed the ability to maintain and update a
          database of articles, alongside other sorting, display, and editing
          features.

          <strong> The solution: </strong> A clean, engaging platform with an
          MySQL article database and a custom CMS for simplified administrator
          editing.

          <p>
            Much of the typography and styling elements from the original site
            were carried over to the new one to maintain brand consistency. One
            of the most notable changes is the transition to a more artistic and
            image-forward main page, and more varied organization of the
            articles rather than only grids. Additonally, we wanted a greater
            magazine feature instead of just listing its articles. A prototype
            was designed in Figma with other members of the BPR Web Team, which
            has served as my basis moving forward.

          <p>
            My next step was to begin the article database. Each article needed
            to contain a title, a brief description, an author, a date, the
            categories it was a part of, the cover image, and any additional
            images. Using MySQL, I was able to create a preliminary database
            with a few articles in order to test its functionality. Once
            finalized, all BPR articles can be uploaded, managed, edited, and
            deleted in the database using the CMS.

            A work in progress: In order to make the article system highly
            accessible to editors and staff, many of whom have zero computer
            science experience, it was important to make sure the Content
            Management System was well implemented. I made sure to implement
            CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using SQL queries and will be
            working on implementing a user authentification system to only allow
            administrative staff edit access.

            A work in progress: On the backend, I have work to do on the server,
            framework, API, database integration, and security. For the
            frontend, I have to continue implementing the design from above,
            using React components and Redux for state management.

            As the most complex project I've taken on yet, building this site
            has offered an incredibly special experience to be part of a real
            site's development from start to end. I'm extraordinarily grateful
            to have been given this opportunity by the BPR team, and look
            forward to its continued progress and launch upon our return to
            school in the fall.
