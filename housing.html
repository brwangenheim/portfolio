          <strong> The challenge: </strong> Every May, Brown facebook groups and
          instagram stories are flooded with students desperate to pass off
          their leases for the three months of summer break. Instead of
          cross-searching platforms, my goal was to create a singular site that
          connects leasers and subletters without all the hassle-- while
          preserving the privacy and security of students. This is only the
          front end, though I hope to continue working and implement a back-end
          (and possible launch!).

            This was a great opportunity to gain more experience using React. I
            chose to create a mock Brown subletting site, something my friends
            and I had been in discussion about the need for. My intention was to
            create a site where users could search through (hypothetically
            uploaded) housing options based on various parameters. The sort
            features allow the default order or price sorting, while the filters
            allow users to choose parameters such as number of beds, type of
            housing, or the ter they want to sublet for. Finally, there is a
            saved listing aggregator, which tracks what listings the user saves.
            Using components, props, and states, my interface allows for full
            functionality. Users are fully able to sort, aggregate, and filter
            the housing data provided with a dropdown menu for each parameter.

            Overall, this project encouraged me to take on new challenges in
            using reactive design components, and carefully consider the various
            forms that simple features like sorting or filtering or favoriting
            can take. I loved learning how to combine aesthetic design
            components with interactive interfaces. If I chose to implement this
            site beyond just the mocked front-end, future steps would include
            implementing my back end, ensuring security and authentification
            measures, integrating a map API, and creating a secure and anonymous
            email function. Either way, this project was a valuable experience
            in using reactive frontend frameworks to create more dynamic sites,
            and I'm looking forward to using these skills as I continue to
            create and improve.
